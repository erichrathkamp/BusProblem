# Project Spec
You can find the spec for the project, including the relevant problem, [here](https://d1b10bmlvqabco.cloudfront.net/attach/jhadltur59wtu/idril7rumak4d3/jocsqsxf370/CS_170_FA18_Project_Spec.pdf).

# Graph generation
The code for the graph generation was created in ipython notebook. In order to generate outputs of your own, simply run the code blocks in order starting from the top (in order to see the image of the graph and the score of our solution.)  

# Output answers
If purely interested in the output files alone, run all the code blocks, but only pay attention to the blocks at or below the one that begins with the comment "###400 Students Solution, 20 buses, 20 capacity".  The code blocks at the very bottom write the graph and rowdy groups to files for you.
